Or how Nat decided to make his own game like a newb.

## Design / Idea

  * Single player
  * Platformer
  * Macro mechanic
    * Looping
    * Game state recording
      * Going to need a start and stop recording.
      * Limit on how long recording can happen for?
      * q and e button probably good.
  * Cloning mechanic
    * Ability to switch between clones
    * Ability to merge clones?
  * Basic platform mechanics
    * Move left, right, jump
  * Art
